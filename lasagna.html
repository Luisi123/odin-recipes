           <h3> <li>For the Lasagna:</li> </h3>

                <li>12 lasagna noodles (regular or no-boil)</li>
                <li>Olive oil for greasing the baking dish</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or pan over medium heat. Add the ground beef (or sausage) and cook until browned, breaking it up into smaller pieces with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion and garlic, and cook for another 2-3 minutes until softened and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and red wine (if using). Add the basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles (if using regular noodles):</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent them from sticking. Lay them flat on a sheet of parchment or wax paper to keep them from sticking together.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</li></h3>
        <ul><li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and parsley. Mix until smooth and well combined.</lil></ul>
        <h3><li>Assemble the Lasagna:</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Start by spreading a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of the dish.</li>
            <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
            <li>Add a layer of meat sauce on top of the ricotta.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, ricotta mixture, meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, remaining meat sauce, and top with the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><li>Bake:</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil (to prevent it from drying out) and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><li>Cool and Serve:</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 10-15 minutes before cutting into it, as it will hold its shape better.</li>
            <li>Serve with a side salad or garlic bread for a complete meal!</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
